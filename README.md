# Pitch-Tuner
A pitch correction app that lets users detect the key of uploaded beats/music tracks and identify any detuning in cents. Users can then shift the pitch to the correct key(Closest key if not specified) and download the tuned version.

### Work in Progress: Code is ready, need to create a UI for it.
